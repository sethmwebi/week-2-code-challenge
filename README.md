## Week Two Code Challenge

The following program allows a user to add a new item to a purchase list. The new item is added to a list below and allows for marking whether it has actually been purchased or not. The user can then click the "mark purchased" button to indicate that he/she has purchased the item. Upon indicating that the item has successfully been purchased, a line striking through item text appears. There is also an "X" mark icon after the item that allows the user to completely remove the item from the purchase list.
